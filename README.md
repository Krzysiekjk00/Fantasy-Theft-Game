# Fantasy-Theft-Game
In order to revise OOP knowledge, I am writing a simple adventure Zork-like game.
The game is about a thief, who is burgling middleage-like residence in order to
steal a priceless artifact from the treasury. The thief (player) has to be careful
not to wake up the owners as well as to keep away from guards or fight them silently
not to raise the alarm. The player has an inventory consisting of weapon and
stealing tools. A weapon can inflict a certain amount of damage. The thief has
health points as well.
